- Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications.
- Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities.

- The most common form of Authentication is using a username and password mechanism.
- Session Cookies:
    - If user credentials is verified by the server, it will then provide the users browser with a session cookie.
    - This is needed because web servers use HTTP(S) to communicate (Stateless)
    - Attaching session cookies means that the server will know who is sending what data, that way the server can keep track of the users actions.

- If an attacker is able to fine flaws in an Authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other users accounts.
- This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application)
- Common Authentication flaws:
    - Brute-force Attacks:
        - If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess 
          the username and password using multiple Authentication attempts.
    - Weak Credentials:
        - Web applications should set strong password policies.
        - If applications allow users to set passwords such as "password", then the attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts.
        - They can do so without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
    - Weak Session Cookies:
        - Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users.
        - If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users accounts.

- Prevent broken Authentication:
    - Avoid password guessing attacks by ensuring the application enforces a strong password policy.
    - Avoid brute force attacks by ensuring that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain amount of login attempts.
    - Implement Multi Factor Authentication, if a user has multiple methods of authentication, it would be difficult for an attacker to get 
      access to both credentials and access the account.
