- XML (eXtensible Markup Language):
    - This is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format 
      that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

    - It is a markup language used for storing and transporting data.
    - It is platform-independent and programming language independent.
    - Data which is stored and transported using XML can be changed at any point in time without affecting the data presentation.
    - XML allows validation using DTD and Schema. This validation ensures that the XML document is free from any syntax errors.
    - It simplifies data sharing between various systems because of its platform-independent nature. XML data doesn't require any 
      conversion when transferred between different systems.
    


- XML External Entity (XXE):
    - This attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data.

    - It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application 
      itself can access and allow the attacker to read the files on the system.

    - This can also cause a DOS attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 
      inducing the web application to make requests to other applications.

    - XXE may also enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.

    - Types of XXE attacks:
        - In-Band XXE: The attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.

        - Out-Of-Band XXE (Blind XXE): No immediate response from the web application and the attacker 
          has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file, or their own server.
