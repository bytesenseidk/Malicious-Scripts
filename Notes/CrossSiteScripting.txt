- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications.
- It is a type of injection which can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts and have it execute on a victims machine.
- A web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input.
- XSS is possible in Javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS.

- Main Cross-Site Scripting Methods:
    - Stored XSS:
        - This is the most dangerous type of XSS.
        - It is where a malicious string originates from the websites database.
        - This often happens when a website allows user input that is not sanitized, to be inserted into the database.

    - Reflected XSS:
        - A malicious payload is part of the victims request to a website.
        - The website includes this payload in response back to the user.
        - An attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload.
    
    - DOM-Based XSS (Type-0 XSS):
        - DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documets.
        - It represents the page so that programs can change the document structre, style and content.
        - It is a XSS attack where the payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment in the victims browser 
          used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an unexpected manner.
        - The page itself (HTTP response) does not change, but the client side code contained in the page, executes differently 
          due to the malicious modifications that have occured in the DOM environment.


- Common XSS Payloads:
    - Create a Hello World message popup on users browser:
        <script>alert("Hello World")</script>
    
    - Override the websites HTML to add your own:
        document.write()
    
    - Log all keystrokes of a user with this keylog payload:
