- Security Misconfigurations occur when security was not configured properly.

- Security Misconfigurations include:
    - Poorly configured permissions on cloud services (like S3 buckets).
    - Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.
    - Default accounts with unchanged passwords.
    - Error messages that are overly detailed and allow an attacker to find out more about the system.
    - Not using HTTP Security Headers, or revealing too much detail in the Server: HTTP header.

- This vulnerability can often lead to more vulnerabilities, such as default credentials giving access to sensitive data, 
  XXE or Command Injection on admin pages.


- Default Passwords:
    - Particuarly common in embedded and IOT devices, and often owners doesn't change these passwords.
    - It is easy to imagine the risk of default credentials from an attackers point of view. 
      Being able to gain access to admin dashboards, services designed for system administrators or manufactures, 
      or even network infrastructure could be incredibly useful in attacking a business. 
      From data exposure to easy RCE, the effects of default credentials can be severe.

    - History:
        - In October 2016, DYN (a DNS proider) was taken offline by one of the most memorable DDoS attacks of the past 10 years.
          The flood of traffic came mostly from Internet of Things ant networking devices like routers and modems, 
          infected with the Mirai malware. 
        - This malware had a list of 63 username/password pairs, and attempted to log in to exposed telnet services.
        - The DDoS attack took down large websites like Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Github, and many more, for over several hours.
